# Understanding Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) in Power Platform

## Application Lifecycle Management

Traditionally, ALM is used to manage the releases and maintenance of solutions. In the Power Platform, the concept remains similar but incorporates additional components. Letâ€™s explore what ALM entails in the Power Platform.

## Application Lifecycle Management in Power Platform

The process of managing the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of applications across environments.

### Key Components

#### Environment Strategy
- Use dedicated environments for Development (Dev), Testing (Test), and Production (Prod).
- Set up a sandbox environment for experimentation or exploratory development.

#### Solution Management
- **Unmanaged Solutions**: Used in the development environment to allow edits to components.
- **Managed Solutions**: Deployed to Test and Prod environments to lock the components for stability and consistency.
- Use version control solutions to track changes over time.

#### Source Control
- Store and manage solutions in systems like Git, Azure DevOps, or GitHub.
- Include all customizations and configurations in source control for collaboration and rollback if necessary.

#### Build and Release Automation
- Use Azure DevOps pipelines or GitHub Actions for CI/CD of solutions.
- Automate solution export, import, and deployment processes to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.

#### Configuration Data Management
- Use Environment Variables for environment-specific configurations like API keys, URLs, or connection strings.
- Export and import reference data as part of solution deployments when required.

#### Application Monitoring
- Use Power Platform Analytics and monitoring tools to track application performance, usage, and errors.
- Enable telemetry for custom components to gather insights and ensure operational reliability.

#### Change Management
- Establish a change control process for managing updates and enhancements to applications.
- Maintain a changelog or version history to document changes and their impact.

#### Testing
- Conduct Functional Testing to validate application logic.
- Perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in the Test environment with actual users.
- Automate testing using tools like the Power Platform Testing Framework.

#### Governance and Security
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for environments and solutions.
- Use DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance.
- Regularly audit solutions for security and compliance adherence.

## Deployment Best Practices
- Deploy managed solutions to Test and Prod environments for stability.
- Perform post-deployment smoke testing to verify successful implementation.
- Have a rollback plan for critical deployments to minimize downtime.

## Preparing a Solution for Deployment

### The Use of Solutions in Power Platform
- For an editable backup: Create an **unmanaged solution**.
- For Test or Prod deployment: Use **managed solutions** to prevent edits.

### Creating a Solution
- Group all elements in a solution before development starts to manage dependencies.
- Note: Apps or flows belonging to multiple solutions reflect changes across all unless cloned.

## The Deployment Process

1. **Complete Development in the Development Environment**
   - Design, build, and test thoroughly.
   - Use source control for version tracking.
   - Package all components into an unmanaged solution.
   - Perform functional testing locally.

2. **Export Solution from Dev**
   - Publish all customizations.
   - Export as managed or unmanaged (based on the deployment stage).
   - Assign a version number for tracking (e.g., `1.0.0.0`).

3. **Deploy the Solution to the Test Environment**
   - Import the solution as a managed solution.
   - Validate dependencies and prepare test data.
   - Conduct functional and performance testing.
   - Address feedback and redeploy updated solutions.

4. **Export Solution from Test**
   - Export the approved solution as a managed solution.
   - Increment the version number (e.g., `1.0.0.1`).

5. **Deploy to the Production Environment**
   - Validate dependencies and backup existing configurations.
   - Import the managed solution and update environment-specific settings.
   - Perform smoke testing and go live.
  
## Exporting a Solution
An existing solution is exported as managed or unmanaged, depending on the reason for export.

## Importing a Solution
Importing a solution that already exists overwrites the existing solution. It does not automatically update the version number. It uses the version number provided when the solution was exported.

## Managing Solution Versions and Updates

- **Version Format**: Major.Minor.Build.Revision (e.g., `1.0.0.0`).
  - **Major**: Significant changes or new features.
  - **Minor**: Small enhancements or non-breaking changes.
  - **Build**: Incremental updates or bug fixes.
  - **Revision**: Hotfixes or minor adjustments.
- Increment version numbers before exporting solutions.
- Maintain a changelog and test thoroughly before deployment.

## Restoring a Previous App Version
Unless you have an exported version of the solution, you cannot revert the version of any product other than Apps. It is important to keep source control updated with any feature changes to the different components of a solution.

## Best Practices for Maintaining and Evolving Low-Code Applications

### Version Control
- Track changes using Git, Azure DevOps, or similar tools.

### Environment Separation
- Use distinct environments for Dev, Test, and Prod.

### Solution Management
- Use managed solutions in Test and Prod environments.

### Governance and Compliance
- Establish standards and implement role-based access control.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy laws and audit regularly.

### Documentation
- Maintain updated documentation for all stages of the lifecycle.
- Provide user guides and version histories.

### Regular Maintenance
- Address bugs promptly and test fixes before deployment.
- Review workflows for efficiency and relevance.

### Security
- Use secure authentication methods and encrypt sensitive data.
- Enable auditing and use environment variables for secure configurations.

### Scalability and Future-Proofing
- Build modular apps for easier updates.
- Reuse components and anticipate future requirements.
