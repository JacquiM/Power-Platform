# Components of Data Modelling and the ETL/ELT Process
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process is a cornerstone of data management and integration. It is used to optimize workflows and maintain data integrity by moving data from source systems to a centralized repository or target system for analysis, reporting, or other business needs. This process ensures data is accessible, consistent, and prepared for use in decision-making and application development.
Integrating these ETL/ELT components ensures data workflows are efficient, secure, and ready to support scalable, data-driven applications.

To optimize workflows and maintain data integrity, it is crucial to integrate best practices from the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process.

## Key Steps:
1. **Extract:**
   - Gather raw data from diverse sources (e.g., SharePoint, SQL Server, Excel).
   - Ensure proper security protocols during extraction, such as OAuth authentication.

2. **Transform:**
   - Clean, enrich, and structure data using tools like Power Query.
   - Apply common transformations: removing duplicates, modifying data types, and merging columns.

3. **Load:**
   - Push prepared data into Dataverse or other storage solutions.
   - Schedule automatic refreshes to maintain updated datasets.

## Maintaining ETL Principles in Power Platform:
- Leverage Power Query for consistent and reusable transformations.
