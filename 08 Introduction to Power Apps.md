# Types of Power Apps

Power Apps are categorized into **Canvas Apps, Model-Driven Apps, and Portals**, each serving unique use cases and development needs.

## **Canvas Apps**  
These are highly customizable applications that provide a **drag-and-drop** design experience. Developers can create visually rich interfaces by placing elements on a blank canvas, making it ideal for **tailored workflows and specific use cases**.

## **Model-Driven Apps**  
These apps focus on **data and processes** rather than the user interface. Built using **Dataverse**, they offer **standardized UI components** and are best suited for **business applications requiring robust data structures and automation**.

## **Portals**  
Portals allow **external users** to interact securely with business data through **customizable websites**. They are commonly used for **customer self-service, partner management, and external-facing applications**.
