# Introduction to Visualizations

## Reports vs Dashboards

| Feature           | Report                          | Dashboard                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Type**     | Historical, detailed data       | Real-time, summary data          |
| **Purpose**       | In-depth analysis and documentation | Quick insights and real-time monitoring |
| **Interactivity** | Static, non-interactive         | Interactive, drill-down capabilities |
| **Presentation**  | Structured, formal presentation | Visual, concise presentation     |

### When to Use Reports
- **In-Depth Analysis:** For detailed information and documentation.
- **Compliance and Audits:** For regulatory purposes.
- **Historical Data:** To analyze trends or past performance.
- **Formal Presentations:** For structured reporting.

### When to Use Dashboards
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track live data and performance.
- **Key Metrics & KPIs:** Visualize business metrics.
- **Quick Decision-Making:** High-level insights for rapid decisions.
- **Interactivity:** Explore data interactively with filters and drill-through.

### Visualization Types
- **Bar Charts:** Compare categories and trends over time.
- **Line Charts:** Show changes over time for continuous data.
- **Pie Charts:** Display proportions or parts of a whole.
- **Tables:** Present exact values and detailed comparisons.
- **Scatter Plots:** Highlight relationships or correlations between variables.
- **Heat Maps:** Visualize data density or variation.
- **Gauges & KPIs:** Show key metrics against targets.
- **Maps:** Visualize geographic data and spatial relationships.

### Choosing the Right Visualization Based on Data Type
Power BI provides a range of visualization types, and selecting the right one—such as bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, or maps for geographic data—is essential for effective communication of insights.
| Data Type       | Recommended Visualizations                     | Use Case                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Categorical**  | Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Treemap, Table           | Comparing categories (e.g., sales by region)      |
| **Time Series**  | Line Chart, Area Chart, Heat Map              | Showing trends over time                          |
| **Continuous**   | Line Chart, Scatter Plot, Histogram           | Distribution and relationships (e.g., age vs salary) |
| **Geospatial**   | Map, Heat Map, Geo Chart                      | Visualizing geographic data                       |
| **Performance**  | KPI, Gauge, Bar Chart                         | Monitoring progress toward goals                 |
| **Proportions**  | Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Bar Chart      | Showing parts of a whole (e.g., budget allocation) |

## Effective Use of Colors in Visualizations

### Purpose of Colors
- Enhance readability and interpretability.
- Draw attention to key data points.
- Convey emotional tone (e.g., red for negative, green for positive).

### Principles for Using Colors
- **Consistency:** Use consistent colors across similar data types.
- **Contrast:** Ensure text and data stand out against backgrounds.
- **Accessibility:** Use color-blind friendly palettes.
- **Context:** Align colors with the intended message.

### Suggested Colors for Data Types

| Data Type           | Suggested Colors                 | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Categorical Data** | Distinct, contrasting colors     | Differentiate between categories clearly       |
| **Time Series Data** | Gradient color schemes          | Represent progression or change over time      |
| **Negative/Positive**| Red (negative), Green (positive)| Show contrasting values (e.g., profit vs loss) |
| **Distribution Data**| Sequential color schemes        | Show range or intensity of a distribution      |
| **Proportions**      | Monochromatic color schemes      | Indicate parts of a whole                     |

## Best Practices for Colors in Reports and Dashboards

- Use a **limited color palette** to avoid overwhelming viewers.
- Ensure **contrast** for text readability.
- Use **accent colors** to highlight critical data points.
- Avoid excessive use of bright or saturated colors.
- Consider **color-blind friendly palettes** for accessibility.
