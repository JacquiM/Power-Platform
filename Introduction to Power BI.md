# Introduction to Visualizations

## Reports vs Dashboards

| Feature           | Report                          | Dashboard                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Type**     | Historical, detailed data       | Real-time, summary data          |
| **Purpose**       | In-depth analysis and documentation | Quick insights and real-time monitoring |
| **Interactivity** | Static, non-interactive         | Interactive, drill-down capabilities |
| **Presentation**  | Structured, formal presentation | Visual, concise presentation     |

### When to Use Reports
- **In-Depth Analysis:** For detailed information and documentation.
- **Compliance and Audits:** For regulatory purposes.
- **Historical Data:** To analyze trends or past performance.
- **Formal Presentations:** For structured reporting.

### When to Use Dashboards
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track live data and performance.
- **Key Metrics & KPIs:** Visualize business metrics.
- **Quick Decision-Making:** High-level insights for rapid decisions.
- **Interactivity:** Explore data interactively with filters and drill-through.

## Data Visualization in Power BI
Data visualization helps transform raw data into actionable insights by displaying it in a visual format. Different types of data require different types of visualizations and color schemes to effectively convey the right message. Power BI supports various visualization types, tailored to different data and purposes.

### Visualization Types
- **Bar Charts:** Compare categories and trends over time.
- **Line Charts:** Show changes over time for continuous data.
- **Pie Charts:** Display proportions or parts of a whole.
- **Tables:** Present exact values and detailed comparisons.
- **Scatter Plots:** Highlight relationships or correlations between variables.
- **Heat Maps:** Visualize data density or variation.
- **Gauges & KPIs:** Show key metrics against targets.
- **Maps:** Visualize geographic data and spatial relationships.

### Choosing the Right Visualization Based on Data Type
Power BI provides a range of visualization types, and selecting the right one—such as bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, or maps for geographic data—is essential for effective communication of insights.
| Data Type       | Recommended Visualizations                     | Use Case                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Categorical**  | Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Treemap, Table           | Comparing categories (e.g., sales by region)      |
| **Time Series**  | Line Chart, Area Chart, Heat Map              | Showing trends over time                          |
| **Continuous**   | Line Chart, Scatter Plot, Histogram           | Distribution and relationships (e.g., age vs salary) |
| **Geospatial**   | Map, Heat Map, Geo Chart                      | Visualizing geographic data                       |
| **Performance**  | KPI, Gauge, Bar Chart                         | Monitoring progress toward goals                 |
| **Proportions**  | Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Bar Chart      | Showing parts of a whole (e.g., budget allocation) |

## Effective Use of Colors in Visualizations

### Purpose of Colors
- Enhance readability and interpretability.
- Draw attention to key data points.
- Convey emotional tone (e.g., red for negative, green for positive).

### Principles for Using Colors
- **Consistency:** Use consistent colors across similar data types.
- **Contrast:** Ensure text and data stand out against backgrounds.
- **Accessibility:** Use color-blind friendly palettes.
- **Context:** Align colors with the intended message.

### Suggested Colors for Data Types

| Data Type           | Suggested Colors                 | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Categorical Data** | Distinct, contrasting colors     | Differentiate between categories clearly       |
| **Time Series Data** | Gradient color schemes          | Represent progression or change over time      |
| **Negative/Positive**| Red (negative), Green (positive)| Show contrasting values (e.g., profit vs loss) |
| **Distribution Data**| Sequential color schemes        | Show range or intensity of a distribution      |
| **Proportions**      | Monochromatic color schemes      | Indicate parts of a whole                     |

---

## Best Practices for Colors in Reports and Dashboards

- Use a **limited color palette** to avoid overwhelming viewers.
- Ensure **contrast** for text readability.
- Use **accent colors** to highlight critical data points.
- Avoid excessive use of bright or saturated colors.
- Consider **color-blind friendly palettes** for accessibility.
